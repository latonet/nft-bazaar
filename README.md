# nft-bazaar - an NFT markeplace

An NFT Marketplace for unique and exclusive niche NFT assets and to offer an alternative NFT marketplace to creators, in not only mainstream but also niche areas. Many of the assets on offer in our marketplace will be unique and exclusive. 

This project will enable some creators not currently well represented in existing NFT marketplaces to offer their assets and reach their target markets in a new and exciting marketplace. We believe many of our creators are not currently active in existing NFT marketplaces.

Our team has considerable experience in developing websites and apps and we're excited to bring this experience to the NFT marketplace. Our niche NFT assets will target creators and their buyers not currently well catered for.
